        <h3><a href="https://github.com/rijenkii/arduino-wiitar-adapter">Arduino
                Wiitar Adapter</a></h3>
        <p>This is an open-source DIY alternative to Raphnet Wii adapters. I
            have made it because I'm fucking broke, and I didn't see anything
            difficult in building an adapter from scratch. And it really wasn't
            that difficult - a breadboard, Arduino, couple of power level
            converters and about 150 lines of code. AND it works on Android!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/rijenkii/chip8">Rust Chip-8
                interpreter</a></h3>
        <p>This is more of a toy project. I have wanted to write an emulator for
            a long time, and CHIP-8 looked like a good starting point. It was
            fun to code, less (but still) fun to debug, and finally launching
            tetris on this thing and not crashing was a reward in itself. It's
            not finished, but I'm probably not going to touch it any time soon.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/rijenkii/xdg-user-rs">xdg-user</a></h3>
        <p>After the whole <code>dirs</code> kerfuffle, I was browsing crates,
            and discovered that <code>xdg</code> crate did not support the user
            part of xdg, and so I decided to write it myself.</p>
